// This is a simple class to create a MIME document.  To use, allocate
// a new GTMMIMEDocument and start adding parts as necessary.  When you are
// done adding parts, call generateInputStream to get an NSInputStream
// containing the contents of your MIME document.
//
// A good reference for MIME is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

// Get or set the unique boundary for the parts that have been added.

// Adds a new part to this mime document with the given headers and body.
// The headers keys and values should be NSStrings.
// Adding a part may cause the boundary string to change.
